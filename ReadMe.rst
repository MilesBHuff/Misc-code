Miles's miscellaneous scriptlets & applets

About
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| This repository contains a number of scripts and such that I've written over
  the years.  The code in this repository is generally too small to warrant its
  own repo.  A lot of it ends up in ``~/.local/``;  that which doesn't, is in
  special subfolders under ``./bin``.
| Code which is better classified as a "dotfile" belongs in the Dotfiles
  repository.

| As much as possible, I have tried to create all these files myself.  Files
  (and bits of files) that I did not make myself, *should* be indicated as such;
  these such bits may have a different license than below;  the only files for
  which the licenses are truly known are non-code, and files with their licenses
  indicated in a comment.  Should you find that anything in my dotfiles is
  incompatible with the LGPL3 or CC BY-SA 4.0 (depending upon the filetype),
  please let me know, and I will rewrite the component(s) in-question.  I aim to
  abide by all the laws of the United States of America.
